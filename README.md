# Refer & Earn Demo Bot

This is a simple but powerful **demo bot** built using the Bots.Business platform.  
It includes **only the most important features** needed for a successful Refer & Earn system — nothing extra, no web app, no smart features — just what really matters.

The goal of this bot is to **demonstrate all core features** used in referral and affiliate campaigns.

It also uses `mclib` to check if users are members of required channels before giving rewards — just like in real referral bots.

This bot is **perfect for beginners** who want to learn how Refer & Earn bots work on Bots.Business.  
It's clean, focused, and ready for real use or learning.

> A complete reference for anyone who wants to build a referral bot — simple, powerful, and to the point.
