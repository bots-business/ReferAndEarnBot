## 🧑‍💻 User Interface Overview

This bot offers a clean and smooth user experience with a focus on **clarity**, **ease of use**, and a **premium interactive feel** — all using the Bots.Business platform.

### 🚀 Starting the Bot

When a user starts the bot using the `/start` command, the bot checks whether the user has joined all the **required channels or groups**:

- ✅ **If the user is a member of all required channels**:  
  They see a **welcome message** along with a clean inline button menu.

- ❌ **If the user hasn't joined all required channels**:  
  The bot sends a message listing the required channels to join.  
  The list is fully dynamic — admins can manage the channels from the **admin panel** without touching the code.

### 🔘 Main Menu Buttons

Once users pass the channel check, they are shown a menu with the following buttons:

- 📢 **Refer & Earn** – Get your unique invite link and track referrals.  
- 💬 **Help & Support** – Contact admin or read basic help info.  
- 💼 **Balance & Account** – View your current balance and invite stats.  
- 🎁 **Bonus** – Claim periodic bonus,   
- 🏦 **Set Wallet (Withdraw)** – Users can enter their withdrawal address or wallet.

### ✨ Premium Interaction

- Tapping any button **edits the current message** in place, creating a clean and modern app-like experience.
- This editing behavior helps keep the chat uncluttered and feels similar to how premium Telegram bots work.
- When a user sends a **command manually** (like `/bonus`), the bot replies with a **new message**, since message IDs aren’t available for editing in that case.

### 🔄 Referral Flow

- If a user starts the bot from a **referral link**, the bot tracks the inviter.
- Once the new user joins all required channels, the inviter receives a **referral bonus**, defined in the admin panel.
- Both users (inviter and invitee) receive confirmation messages about the referral status and bonuses.

### ⚙️ Membership Check Modes

- On `/start`, the bot checks user membership using **`MCL`** (Membership Checker Lib).
- There is also a **background check option**:  
  If enabled from the admin panel, the bot will check membership on **every command** automatically.  
  > Note: This will deduct additional iterations from the admin’s Bots.Business account.

This interface is designed to be clear and beginner-friendly, while still delivering a powerful and professional experience — exactly what a Refer & Earn bot needs.

## 🔗 Referral Link Generation

The bot includes a well-structured referral system that demonstrates how referral-based growth can be implemented cleanly within Bots.Business.

When the user clicks the `📢 Refer & Earn` button, the bot edits the current message (to maintain a clean interface) and displays:

- A customizable **referral preview image** (set via the admin panel)
- The user’s **unique referral link**, auto-generated using their Telegram ID
- The **total number of invites** they've attracted
- The **bonus per invite** and the **reward currency**

All of the above values — including the referral link prefix, bonus amount, and currency — are fully dynamic and can be managed in real-time from the **admin panel**, allowing admins to update reward logic without code changes. Default values are in place to ensure smooth operation out of the box.

![Referral Link pae](https://i.ibb.co/6V5VCzW/Screenshot-2025-04-09-16-29-45-885-org-telegram-messenger-web-edit.jpg)


### 🧩 Interactive Inline Buttons

- **My Invites**  
  Shows a list of users invited by the current user, the **total invite count**, and the **timestamp of the first invite**. This functionality uses the `referral-lib` for accurate tracking.

- **Top List**  
  Displays a **leaderboard** of top inviters, showing each user’s invite count. This provides a competitive incentive and transparency within the referral ecosystem.

- **Copy Link**  
  Utilizes the latest Telegram Bot API to offer a `copy_text` button, improving user convenience for sharing.

- **Back**  
  Smoothly navigates back to the previous message by editing it — enhancing the premium, app-like experience.

This section showcases how a referral system can be fully implemented with dynamic configuration, clean message management, and modular control — ideal for both real-world use and educational purposes for developers learning referral systems on the Bots.Business platform.

---

## 🛠 Help & Support

When the user clicks the **Help & Support** button, the bot smoothly **edits the current message** to display a clean and customizable "About the Bot" section. This section isn't hardcoded — it can be fully updated at any time directly from the admin panel, without needing to touch the source code. This makes it ideal for dynamic projects.
We have tow inline button `Ask a question` & `Back`for visiting last page.

Clicking **Ask Question** prompts the user to explain their issue. The bot accepts **any type of message** — text, photos, videos, stickers, voice, etc. Whatever the user sends next is treated as their support request.

Behind the scenes, the message is **Copied to the first admin** configured in the admin panel. The admin receives it with two inline buttons:
- `✅ Reply`
- `❌ Ignore`

If **Ignore** is selected, the user is not notified, and the request is silently dismissed (a clean way to handle spam or non-issues).  
If **Reply** is selected, the bot prompts the admin to send a reply in **any format** (text, photo, video, etc.), maintaining the same freedom of communication. The reply is then delivered to the user along with an `Ask Again` button so they can continue the conversation if needed.

This minimal but complete support workflow gives both user and admin a premium experience — fast, controlled, and efficient — and demonstrates how even complex interactions can be implemented cleanly using Bots.Business. It's a great reference for developers learning to build support flows, thanks to its clear structure, practical use of media handling, and user/admin feedback loop.

## 💼 Balance & Account

Clicking the **Balance & Account** button triggers a smooth in-place message edit (inline UX) that gives the user a clear summary of their referral profile. If the user runs the `/balance` command directly (without a message ID), the bot smartly sends a new standalone message — maintaining a polished experience in both contexts.

The account overview includes:

- **User ID**: Telegram numeric ID  
- **Name**: Display name from Telegram  
- **Username**: Telegram @username (if available)  
- **Invited By**: The user who referred them (shows `None` if user joined directly)
- **Referral Link**: User's unique invite link  
- **Balance**: Total earned via referrals
- **Wallet Address**: Set by the user for withdrawals (`Not Set` if they haven’t added it yet)

Inline buttons included:
- `🔗 Copy Referral Link` — copies the link using the latest Telegram API support for clipboard interaction
- `Withdraw` — Request for an withdraw.
- `🔙 Back` — returns to the previous interface

This section gives users complete visibility into their invite stats and wallet setup without clutter or confusion.

---

## 🎁 Periodic Bonus

The **Bonus** button gives users the option to claim a periodic reward — a simple yet effective way to boost user engagement in your referral bot.

When the user taps the button, the bot checks if the configured time interval since their last claim has passed. If eligible, the specified bonus amount is instantly credited to their balance. If not, they’re informed how much time is left before they can claim again.

This is not limited to a daily bonus — the **claim period** and **bonus amount** are fully customizable via the **Admin Panel**. Whether it's every 1 hour, 6 hours, or 24 hours, the bot is built to adapt without any code changes.

This flexible, no-frills implementation makes it ideal for showcasing real-world reward logic while keeping things simple and highly configurable for developers and admins alike.

![Bonus claim](https://i.ibb.co/MxsyX10h/Screenshot-2025-04-10-10-01-48-910-org-telegram-messenger-web-edit.jpg)

## 💼 Set Wallet
Upon clicking the **Set Wallet** button, users are prompted to send the `/setwallet` command followed by their wallet address. The bot guides them with a clear usage format:

/setwallet TX8D1vExampleWalletAddress

- 💡 **Default Wallet Type**: `TRX (TRC20)`
- ⚙️ **Fully Configurable**: The currency type and wallet requirement can be adjusted from the **Admin Panel**, making the system adaptable for USDT, BNB, or any token of your choice.
- 🔐 **Wallet Usage**: The saved wallet is linked to the user's account and is used when processing withdrawals.
- 🔁 **Change Anytime**: Users can update their wallet simply by sending the command again with a new address.

This implementation is designed to be simple, secure, and highly flexible — ideal for developers learning how to build production-ready referral bots on the Bots.Business platform.

![Setting wallet](https://i.ibb.co/Zz8NMGLT/Screenshot-2025-04-10-10-05-22-095-org-telegram-messenger-web-edit.jpg)

---

## 💸 Withdraw System

Users can withdraw their earnings by clicking the **Withdraw** button or sending `/withdraw <amount>`. The bot provides usage examples and enforces min/max limits, all configurable via the admin panel.

Once a valid request is made:
- Amount is instantly deducted from the user's balance.
- Admins receive a detailed notification in the configured withdraw channel (name, amount, wallet, time).

Admins have two actions:
- ✅ **Amount Sent** – Marks as paid, notifies user, and posts to payout channel.
- ❌ **Declined** – Marks as rejected, notifies user, and updates payout channel.

After approval/rejection, the request message is edited to reflect the status, with a **Delete** button shown only to admins.

## ⚙️ Admin Panel & Flexibality

This table provides a full demonstration of how an **Admin Panel** can be integrated into a bot built on **Bots.Business (BB)**, offering **easy access to all dynamic settings** without needing to touch the bot's internal code.

# Broadcasting

The broadcasting feature allows admins to send messages of any type to all users securely using the powerful BB method: `Bot.runAll`. This feature is exclusive to admins for enhanced security.

## How It Works

 - An admin sends any type of message to the bot (e.g., text, image, GIF, sticker, or manually formatted text).
 - Reply to the sent message with the `/broadcast` command.  
 - The bot will copy and send the message to all users.

 **Benefits**  
   - Supports all message types, including manually formatted text, images, GIFs, stickers, and more.  
   - Ensures a seamless and flexible broadcasting experience.

4. **Broadcast Status**  
   - After initiating a broadcast, the admin receives an instant response with broadcast details.  
   - The broadcast ID is saved as the "last broadcast."  
   - To check the progress, the admin can run `/broadcast_status` to view the status and completion progress of the broadcast.
